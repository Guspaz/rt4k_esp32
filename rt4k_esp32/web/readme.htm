- To connect to wifi, copy a "wifi.ini" file into the root of the SD card with the following format:
    - ssid = &lt;ssid\\_here&gt;<br>
password = &lt;password\\_here&gt;
- The ESP32 will start booting the instant the SD card gets power.
    - The RT4K always powers the SD slot even when the RT4K is off, as long as the RT4K power cable is plugged in.
- Any time the ESP32 accesses the SD card (read or write), it will temporarily disconnect the SD card from the host device (such as the RT4K or Windows)
    - Windows hates this and will unmount the SD card until you physically unplug/replug it
    - The RT4K is fine with it, as long as it's not booting or updating the firmware
- In order to avoid interfering with the RT4K boot or firmware updates, the ESP32 will refuse to try to access the SD card for the first 30 seconds after it boots
	- You can change the timer on the settings page
	- You can disable the locking and have it just delay reading the wifi.ini file, since that also disrupts RT4K boot/firmware updates.
- **WARNING!** WebDAV is very slow. If it's too slow, use the "Disable wifi next boot" button:
    - Click the button
    - Wait for the confirmation
    - Unplug the SD card from the RT4K (or other device)
    - Plug the SD card into its reader connected to your PC
        - If using the SD-WIFI-PRO dev board as your reader, make sure the "SD ESP" dipswitch (1) is set to "SD" (OFF) and the "RD UPLD" dipswitch (2) is set to "RD" (OFF)
    - The SD card will now be mounted to your Windows machine and you can move stuff around with high performance
    - Unplug the SD card and plug it back into the RT4K. It should now boot back up again with wifi enabled.
- To install on a fresh SD-WIFI-PRO:
	- TODO: Instructions here
- To update the ESP32 firmware
    - These instructions are for Windows. MacOS and Linux are supported, check here for instructions: https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFirmwareFlasher
    - Using the SD-WIFI-PRO dev board, set the "RD UPLD" dipswitch (2) to the "UPLD" (ON) position
    - Plug the SD-WIFI-PRO into the dev board and connect the dev board to your PC
    - Open a command prompt
    - Install the "nanoff" tool by typing: <pre>dotnet tool install -g nanoff</pre>
        - You can update the "nanoff" tool later by typing: <pre>dotnet tool update -g nanoff</pre>
    - Figure out which COM port it connected to by running: <pre>nanoff --listports</pre>
        - If you see multiple COM ports listed, follow these instructions on Windows: https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFirmwareFlasher#finding-the-device-com-port-on-windows
    - Update the firmware with the following command: <pre>nanoff --target ESP32\_PSRAM\_REV0 --serialport COM12 --deploy --image "C:\\example\\path\\rt4k_esp32.bin"</pre>
    - Unplug the SD card and plug it in again, either with the dev board in SD reader mode, or into your RT4K.
